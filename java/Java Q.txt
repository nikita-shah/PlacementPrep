Q1)Can we execute a program without main() method?
Ans) Yes, one of the way is static block but in previous version of JDK not in JDK 1.7.

class A3{  
  static{  
  System.out.println("static block is invoked");  
  System.exit(0);  
  }  
} 


Q2) What if the static modifier is removed from the signature of the main method?
Ans)Program compiles. But at runtime throws an error "NoSuchMethodError". 

Q3)Can you use this() and super() both in a constructor?
Ans)No. Because super() or this() must be the first statement.


Q4)Can we overload main() method?
ANS)Yes, by method overloading. You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. 
Let's see the simple example:

class Overloading1{  
  public static void main(int a){  
  System.out.println(a);  
  }  
    
  public static void main(String args[]){  
  System.out.println("main() method invoked");  
  main(10);  
  }  
}  

Output:main() method invoked
       10
	   

Q5)Can we override static method?

ANS)No, you can't override the static method because they are the part of class not object.	
It is because the static method is the part of class and it is bound with class whereas instance method is bound with object 
and static gets memory in class area and instance gets memory in heap.  

Q6)Can we override the overloaded method?
ANS)Yes.


Q7)Can you declare an interface method static?
ANS)No, because methods of an interface is abstract by default, and static and abstract keywords can't be used together.


Q8)What is marker interface?
ANS)An interface that have no data member and method is known as a marker interface.For example Serializable, Cloneable etc.


Q9)Can we define private and protected modifiers for variables in interfaces?
ANS)No, they are implicitly public.
